# Risksense - Upload to Platform

[Download version 1.1.3](https://github.com/risksense/upload_to_platform/releases/download/v1.1.3/upload_to_platform-v1.1.3.zip)

## Requirements

 - Python 3
    - This script has been tested using Python 3.7+
 - Python Modules (recommend to install using pip):
    - toml
    - urllib3
    - requests
    - progressbar2
   
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Overview
This Python script enables the upload of scan files to the RiskSense platform via the RiskSense API.

When run, the script will take all files from a designated folder, upload them to the RiskSense 
platform, and begin processing of those files.  Once the files have been successfully uploaded, 
the files will be moved into an "archive" subfolder within the original folder.

## Scan File Support
A common question: "Does this script support uploading scan files from *scanner xyz*?"

In short, yes. The script does not perform any enforcement of supported scan file type, and defers 
to the RiskSense platform for scan file support. In other words, the script will upload any scan file 
it finds, regardless of file type, and lets the RiskSense platform sort it out.

## Usage

##### Editing the configuration file (conf/config.toml):
 - Update the platform field as necessary.  
 - Add your API token.  
 - If it is known, you can provide the ID of the desired network (not the network name), and the user 
   will not be prompted to provide or find it.
 - Additionally, if the desired Client ID is known, you can provide it in the config file, and the 
   script will not ask the user about it.
 - If desired, change the paths of the folders containing the files to process and log file.
   - If you specify a custom path_to_files, ___be sure to create a subfolder named "archive" 
     within the folder specified___.

```toml
platform = 'https://platform.risksense.com'

# The API Token can be generated in the RiskSense UI, under User Settings.
api-key = ''

# Specify the path to the folder containing the files you wish to upload.
# If you update this, please use the absolute path to your desired folder.
files_folder = 'files_to_process'

# Specify the path to the folder you would like to use for logging.
# If you update this, please use the absolute path to your desired folder.
log_folder = 'logs'

# Trigger URBA upon completion of upload processing.
auto_urba = true

# You may uncomment this parameter and enter the desired network ID for your upload here if you already know it.
#network_id =

# You may uncomment this parameter and enter the desired client ID for your upload here if you already know it.
#client_id =

use_proxy = false

[proxy]
    host = ''
    port = 3128
    authentication = false
    user = ''
    password = ''

```


##### Running upload_to_platform.py:

After configuring the script, it can be executed as follows:
```commandline
python upload_to_platform.py
```

##### Advanced Usage
Any of the settings found in the configuration file can be overridden through the use of arguments 
at the time of execution.
```commandline

python upload_to_platform.py -h
